<h1>As you continue wandering in hopes of finding an exit to this forest, you find a little piece of a map</h1>
<h1>The map is burnt a little at the edges, but you can vaguely make out the shape of the forest</h1>
<h1>Oddly enough the shape is a perfect circle!</h1>
<h1>You also see that at the center of the perfect circle is a giant tree, and you can see that tree in the distance!</h1>

<h3>Do you:</h3>

<p align= "center">

    <button type="button" class = "pure-button" onclick="window.location.href='./Directories/Function/sin.html'">Run to the Tree</button>
    <button type="button" class = "pure-button" onclick="window.location.href='/Directories/Deaths/Bear.html'">Say screw it and walk the other way</button>
